# Security Essentials

## Introduction to Security
Security is a large topic. Security is a defence against malicious actors. Security can be:
- Security in Software Engineering
- Security on Infrastructure
- Security in Kubernetes
- Cybersecurity

Any touchpoint is security relevant. From your office front door (offline) to your company's AWS cloud infrastructure(online). Not only just cloud infrastructure but also internal network, online systems, servers, database, employee's hardware, printer, apps are the gateways for the maicious actors to enter into your company's infrastructure.

Once they unlocks the doors, they can
- Steal customer data
- Secret company data
- Employee data
- Crash servers
- Shut down your application

Note: Security is or should be top priority for any company.
